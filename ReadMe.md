# Updated Portfolio: 4/17

# This Repository is an update to the previously created Working Portfolio of Andrew C. Patison.
* In this Repository, you will find the code behind Andrew C. Patison's working portoflio. The code has been updated since the original deployment of the code at a different web address. The page was updated to include multiple external projects and homeworks that I have worked on since the previous deployment

# Motivation for this Repository
## I have several motivations for deploying this page
*   1. I wanted to improve my original code from my first portolio deployment
*   2. I needed an updated portfolio that included some of my best works from my GT Coding Bootcamp Class
*   3. I needed to refactor the original code, because I have learned so much from when this was last deployed

# Project Problem Solution
* This project does not solve any probems. It was created as a tool for referencing my working portfolio as we move through this class

# Lessons Learned
* While creating this Project, I learned a ton.But in summary, I learned that I have increased my coding knowledge and ability 1000x fold since I last deployed my portfolio. My coding ability has gotten so much better, that when I opened my original code to my protfolio from the first week of class, I decided to just go ahead and delete, literally, every ounce of code that was there.

# Standout
* This project should always stand-out for the sole-purpose that it is a reflection of my progression as a web-developer and how far I have come and will continue to go as I gain more web-development knowledge and coding ability.
